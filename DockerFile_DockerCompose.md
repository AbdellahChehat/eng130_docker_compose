### Multi-Stage Build

- Using the development image can be useful for testing and additional configuration, but the image size may be relatively large. Once everything is working with the development image, multi-stage builds can be used to create a lightweight image, without having to write a new Dockerfile.

- Add another stage with a more lightweight image (FROM node:alpine) and copy any necessary files from the first stage, and then run any necessary commands. For the node app, multi-stage builds reduced the image size from ~805MB to ~250MB.

```
CMD ["node", "app.js"]

FROM node:alpine

WORKDIR /usr/src/app

COPY package*.json ./

RUN npm install -g npm@7.20.6

COPY --from=app /usr/src/app /usr/src/app

EXPOSE 3000

CMD ["node", "app.js"]

```

### Docker Compose 

- Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. With Compose, you use a YAML file to configure your applicationâ€™s services. Then, with a single command, you create and start all the services from your configuration

- Written in yaml
